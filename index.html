      <h2 class="section-title reveal">About Me</h2>
      <div class="about-grid">
        <div class="about-content reveal">
          <p>Since 2020, I've been the Lead PM responsible for all of Apple's translation technologies, driving a team of 50+ engineers and researchers to ship language-barrier-breaking experiences using SOTA, privacy-preserving ML models. Our work helps millions of people navigate a largely English internet, integrate into new societies, travel more effectively, and break down barriers in business and scientific research.</p>
          <p>Apple's MT powers translation across modalities (text, voice, vision, real-time conversation) and surfaces - through the Translate app and system-wide text selection, natively in apps like Safari and Camera, in communication features like Messages, Phone, and FaceTime, through bespoke hardware experiences like Live Translation on AirPods, and across iOS, macOS, iPadOS, and watchOS. I work with teams like design, engineering, research, modeling, QA, product marketing, language experts, accessibility, performance, user research, and partner technology teams like Speech Recognition, Text-to-Speech, LiveText, Sensing & Connectivity to deliver these products. I drive alignment across all functions of the organization, from regular presentations and discussions with executive leadership to coordinating the cross-functional teams needed to ship each feature.</p>
          <p>Before Apple, I built products in healthcare, from India's largest telehealth platform (MediBuddy, 30M+ users) to a parenting and pregnancy health community (Tinystep, 1M+ users). I co-founded Flutur, a tech-for-good nonprofit that gave grassroots NGOs access to funding through simple internet applications. I also built infrastructure at Amazon on the original team behind Amazon Instant Video, now Prime Video. I hold an MS from Stanford (Management Science & Engineering, 4.0 GPA) and a BTech in CS from Manipal Institute of Technology, India.</p>
          <p>I'm passionate about eliminating resource, information, and language gaps at scale.</p>
