        <div class="about-content reveal">
          <p>I lead product for multimodal Machine Translation at Apple, building Apple Intelligence Live Translation — the system that powers real-time translation across iMessage, FaceTime, Phone calls, AirPods, Camera, Safari, and more. My work ships transformer-based encoder-decoder models to billions of devices, optimized for on-device inference through techniques like attention pruning, quantization, and adapter-based specialization — sitting at the intersection of foundation models, privacy-preserving design, and platform-scale product thinking.</p>
          <p>Before Apple, I built products in healthcare — from India's largest telehealth platform (MediBuddy, 30M+ users) to a parenting and pregnancy health community (Tinystep, 1M+ users). I also co-founded a tech-for-good nonprofit and built infrastructure at Amazon that became Prime Video. I hold an MS from Stanford (Management Science & Engineering, 4.0 GPA) and a BTech in CS from Manipal Institute of Technology.</p>
          <p>I'm passionate about eliminating resource, information, and language gaps at scale.</p>
